## Features

- [ ] ST-1. I want to launch Telegram bot which will listen to messages and then do prompts and return reports. The bot should accept messages only from specific user id which I will set in settings. Chats with other users should not work. Tab with telegram bot should have buttons "Start", "Stop", "Listen but not execute commands", and when I open the Telegram Bot chat, it should start listen to immediatelly.
- [ ] ST-2. I want to launch Claude Desktop App and Codex desktop app with predefined prompt.
- [ ] ST-3. Stating page should be reworked. I want to see the following options there: What should be launched (Terminal, Claude chat, Opencode Chat, Claude desktop app, Codex desktop app, Telegram Bot), then Prompt selector (if I choose Telegram, the prompt selection should be disabled), then "Start" button
- [ ] ST-4. On starting screen, I should be able to select folder to work. The selector should be placed at the center. When I click on the selector, the modal with last folders and fodler selector should be opened (already developed). This folder which I select, should be preselected in other tabs
- [ ] ST-5. I want to see app in macos statusbar. When I click on the small button in statusbar, I should see following options: Current folder, "Open terminal", Telegram bot status
